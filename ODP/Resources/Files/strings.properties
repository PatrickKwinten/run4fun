scoring_txt=Set the scoring for this event. Scoring is relative to the personal targetted lapse time for each runner. For example if runner A sets a long target lapse time but in reality records short lapse times runner A will likely score less points than runner B, who sets a long target lapse time and in reality records long lapse times. This allows a less physical runner to still win in points from an athlete.

home_step2_txt=At the start of each lap you must press the start button on your event sign-up page for which the organizer will provide you an URL for. Then: start running! </p><p>Important to remember: Do not run too fast and not too slow. You get rewarded with the most points when you set a time as closest to your target time. Luckily the organizer has setup a margin for the event.</p><p>When you pass the finish-line you must press the stop button to settle your run-time. Repeat this start&stop routine for each additional lapse.
home_step3=Step 3
home_step3_txt=When the event has ended (by the organizer) no more times can be recorded and points to be scored.</p><p>Count your blessings, get a refreshment and wait for the final result. The results for each event are available as a scoreboard on each event. Good luck & enjoy your running!
home_about_txt=<p>Run 4 Fun is a community initiativ. Each year a sport-competition between adults and children is organized for our neighbourhood block. The year before year Run 4 Fun saw light we held a run around the block competition. The team with most lapses around the block would win. We as adults were outnumbered and had no chance of winning. So our only option for the next year would be to out-number the children.</p><p> During a preparation night with beers and silly jokes we came up with the idea for Run 4 Fun: each member for a team sets up their personal target time and whenever you run a lap with a time between the allowed margins you would score points. The team with the highest points would then win! So we started a computer and started coding...</p><p>Ofcourse the first time we tested/used the app the kids were too enthousiastic, run the first couple of rounds as fast as they could to be ahead of their parents and... collapse. This gave us parents/adults the chance to easily run our lapse within the allowed 1 hour and finally beat the children with a higher achieved number of scored points! Our victory was sweet, we had some more beers and (silently) improving our condition for next year's challenge.</p><p>We hope you have fun using this app for your neighbourhood, department or company event. Just enjoy running :-)</p>
